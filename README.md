Learning Objectives:  

Upon successful completion of this project, the student will demonstrate their understanding of how to use API Wrappers in Ruby as well how to create a website using the Sinatra microframework.

 

# Instructions:

Your friend is a baker who recently had a grand opening of their store. Unfortunately, the turnout was less than ideal and your friend suggested creating a website. The goal is to improve the storeâ€™s online presence and hopefully increase foot traffic to the store. Naturally, your friend turns to you for help and hands you some starting suggestions in a google document.

# Client Suggestions:

The front page should
provide information about the bakery
have links to pages where you can see
all cookies
all cakes
all muffins
Each item sold should have
a description
a price
There should be a way for a person on the site to receive an email with a catalog of all items sold
